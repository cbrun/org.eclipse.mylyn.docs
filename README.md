### Wikitext Editor with "Smart Copy/Paste"

This is a friendly fork I kept around for quite some time already. I had no time to propose a patchset yet but will probably at some point if the wikitext team is interested.

When you paste in the wikitext editor (for markdown, textile, creole, mediawiki or adoc files)
- if there is an Image in the system buffer, we will propose you to save the image in the projet and then add the corresponding markup to include it in the document
- if there is HTML content in the system buffer, we will convert this to the current markup and paste the content

You can install it through the update-site: http://marketplace.obeonetwork.com/updates/nightly/wikitext/site
